Some of my buildings projects

These images showcase the projects I have worked on for the past 3-ish years.

Brews and bites/Glide!
  :the most accurate representation of my skills and what I can do
Architectual Studies
  :random stuff  (often crude/unfinished) built purely for the purpose of experimentation.
Commissions
  :also decent representation of my abilities, all of which are playable.
